## 🎯 About AC3

The **AC3 (Agile and Cognitive Cloud-edge Continuum)** project is developing an innovative framework to efficiently manage data and services across the cloud-edge computing continuum (CECC). By bridging the gap between centralized cloud data centers and distributed edge computing resources, AC3 enables next-generation applications that demand low latency, high data throughput, and intelligent resource management.

### 🚀 Vision

AC3 creates a unified platform that spans from core cloud infrastructure to edge and far-edge devices, enabling intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient service delivery. The framework leverages AI, machine learning, and context-aware algorithms to optimize resource allocation and application deployment across this computing continuum.

## 🎓 Project Overview

**Programme:** Horizon Europe - Digital, Industry and Space  
**Topic:** HORIZON-CL4-2022-DATA-01  
**Funding Scheme:** HORIZON-RIA (Research and Innovation Actions)  
**Coordinator:** WINGS ICT SOLUTIONS INFORMATION & COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IKE (Greece)

Edge computing represents a paradigm shift from traditional centralized data centers, bringing computation and data storage closer to the source. AC3 takes this concept further by creating an **agile framework** that manages the entire cloud-edge computing continuum as a unified, federated platform.
